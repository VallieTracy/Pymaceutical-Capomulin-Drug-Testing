Squamous Cell Carcinoma Drug Testing Analysis
=============================================

**Overview:**
-------------
 In this study, 250 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. 
 
**Findings:**
--------------
-    I'm initially finding that of the 10 drugs tested, only two drugs (Capomulin and Ramicane) actually decreased the size of the tumor.  The tumor increased roughly 44% during the other drug regimen testing. It seems like a large discrepency. 
-    Obviously, I've been hung up on this homework.  Even something as simple as using pyplot versus pandas.  It seems to me that code wise, it isn't substantially different, yet I'm still working to discern between the two.         
-    It's funny, when I was in school for math, I avoided computer science and statistics like the black plague.  And I actually like both of them.  I think I was really hard-headed when I was younger.
