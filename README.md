Squamous Cell Carcinoma Drug Testing Analysis
=============================================

*Report prepared for Pymaceuticals Inc., courtesy of Vallie Tracy*

**Overview:**
-------------
 In this study, 250 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. 
 
**Findings:**
--------------
  -    I'm initially finding that of the 10 drugs tested, only two drugs (Capomulin and Ramicane) actually decreased the size of the tumor.  The tumor increased roughly 44% during the other drug regimen testing. It seems like a large discrepency. 
  -    finding 2  
  -    finding 3
